# Data Preparation & Preprocessing Pipeline

## Objective
Prepare enterprise documents in a format suitable for ingestion into
a RAG-based GenAI system while maintaining accuracy and minimizing noise.

---

## Data Types Handled
- PDF documents
- Excel files
- Structured and semi-structured text

---

## Preprocessing Steps
1. Data cleaning and noise removal
2. Format normalization
3. Metadata enrichment
4. Document segmentation
5. Chunk size optimization
6. Content filtering for relevance

---

## Key Challenges Addressed
- Knowledge base size limitations
- Context fragmentation
- Redundant or irrelevant content
- Inconsistent document structures

---

## Outcome
The preprocessing pipeline ensured:
- Improved retrieval accuracy
- Reduced hallucinations
- Better alignment between retrieved context and generated answers
